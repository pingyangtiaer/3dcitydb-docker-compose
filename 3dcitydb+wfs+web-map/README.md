# 3DCityDB + WFS + Web-Map

This folder contains an example `docker-compose.yml` file for running a 3DCityDB instance with a Web-Feature-Service (WFS) and the 3D-Web-Map-Client. Select the compose file depending on your 3DCityDB and 3DcityDB major version from folder `v3.x.x` or `v 4.x.x`. The services are configured to link the WFS container to the 3DCityDB and use the database as data source. The 3D-Web-Map-Client is configured to host 3D data for visualization in the client from a mapped folder on your Docker host.

## Pull the 3DCityDB images

This ensures you are running the latest version of each image.

```bash
docker pull tumgis/3dcitydb-postgis
docker pull tumgis/3dcitydb-wfs
docker pull tumgis/3dcitydb-web-map
```

### Download the service configuration file

Download the `docker-compose.yml` from this repo using...

* `git`:  

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/tum-gis/3dcitydb-docker-compose
    cd 3dcitydb-docker-compose/3dcitydb+wfs+web-map  
    ```
* ...or `wget`:

   ```bash
   wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tum-gis/3dcitydb-docker-compose/master/3dcitydb%2Bwfs%2Bweb-map/docker-compose.yml
   ```

* ...or `curl`:

    ```bash
    curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tum-gis/3dcitydb-docker-compose/master/3dcitydb%2Bwfs%2Bweb-map/docker-compose.yml -o docker-compose.yml
    ```

## Adapt the service configuration file

Edit the `docker-compose.yml` file according to your needs using the text editor of your choice. You will likely want to:

* Set 3DCityDB coordinate reference system (CRS) and it's GML CRS name: `SRID`, `SRSNAME`
* Change the default database user and password: `POSTGRES_USER`, `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`
  > **Note:** Make sure to change database connections details for the DB and the WFS accordingly!
* Change the 3D-Web-Client data directory: `/var/docker/my-test-data:/var/www/data`

## Run the 3DCityDB services

Use [`docker-compose up`](https://docs.docker.com/compose/reference/up/) to run the services.

  ```bash
  docker-compose up
  ```

The services should now start. Depending on your machine, this is going to take 30-60s. When all services have started successfully they are reachable here, according to the example file.

* Form `localhost`:  
  3DCityDB: localhost  
  WFS web interface: [http://localhost:8080/citydb-wfs/wfsclient](http://localhost:8080/citydb-wfs/wfsclient)  
  WFS OGC WFS interface: [http://localhost:8080/citydb-wfs/wfs?](http://localhost:8080/citydb-wfs/wfs?)  
  3D-Web-Map-Client: [http://localhost](http://localhost)  
* For a host named `myExampleDockerHost.de`:  
  3DCityDB: myExampleDockerHost.de  
  WFS web interface: [http://myExampleDockerHost.de:8080/citydb-wfs/wfsclient](http://myExampleDockerHost.de:8080/citydb-wfs/wfsclient)
